-- DestinyInventoryItemDefinition: "So much of what you see in Destiny is
-- actually an Item used in a new and creative way. This is the definition for
-- Items in Destiny, which started off as just entities that could exist in
-- your Inventory but ended up being the backing data for so much more: quests,
-- reward previews, slots, and subclasses. In practice, you will want to
-- associate this data with "live" item data from a Bungie.Net Platform call:
-- these definitions describe the item in generic, non-instanced terms: but an
-- actual instance of an item can vary widely from these generic definitions."
-- Rows kept: weapons (itemType 3), armor (itemType 2 in one of the five armor
-- buckets), every plug (an item with a plug block; one item can be both) and
-- the Gunsmith Orders, whose icons picture the weapon types (v_weapon).
