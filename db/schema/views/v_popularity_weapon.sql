-- Each weapon d2-perk-popularity scores, one row per side, with what the
-- report shows about it there. pool is its trait pool's label when its family
-- splits (the name after the family's, like "(Pantheon)"), else ''. grid_id
-- names its perk grid (v_popularity_version). hard_copies and hard_votes,
-- normal_copies and normal_votes are its two content groups' voting copies
-- and effective votes; hard_share is the hard group's part of its copies, and
-- endgame is 1 when that clears popularity_rule's bar for the side's badge.
-- confidence, weakest (its label) and weakest_votes come from its weakest
-- column (v_popularity_column), with that column's top pick and its range,
-- and same, which says whether every column has the same votes; all are NULL
-- for a weapon with no scored columns (a fixed roll).
